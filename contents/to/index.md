# to/too/two

**to** = A direction, towards or until, or a relationship between words. "I'm going *to* stab you if you get this wrong after you go *to* kindergarten."

**too** = As well / also. "You *too* can learn to spell at a 1st grade level."

**two** = It's a number. "There are more than *two* ways of getting this shit wrong."

It's pure laziness. Stop it.
