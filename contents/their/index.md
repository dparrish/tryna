# their / they're / there

**their** = Indicates ownership. "*Their* spelling is shit."

**they're** = Shortend form of _they are_, hence the apostrope. "*They're* shit at spelling."

**there** = A place. "Go ride the short bus over *there* until you can spell at a 2nd grade level."


It's pure laziness. Stop it.
